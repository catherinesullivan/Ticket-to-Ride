USER INSTRUCTIONS:

To run the game, run the StartGame Applet. 

Upon running the game you are presented with a screen listing 3 buttons:
    Start Game and How to Play.
    
    How to Play will open a new window that lists the directions for the
        game. Clicking on the left or right side of the screen will scroll
        through each page of the directions. Click on the X in the upper 
        right of the screen to close.
        
    
    Start Game will start a new Ticket to Ride game.
    
        Upon pressing you will be prompted to select 2, 3, or 4 players for
        the game. After choosing, you will enter the names for each player
        with a max number of characters of 13 (clicking ok without a name
        will default it to player1, player2, etc.). Once you enter a name
        you must choose a color that is different from the other player's 
        color.
        
        After entering each name and choosing each color for the players you
        are presented with the game screen. During the first round of each 
        player's turn you will first select a minimum of 3 destination cards 
        out of the 5 that are randomly drawn and displayed in the top right hand
        side of the screen. Hovering over destination cards at any time will 
        highlight the cities they refer to on the map in yellow. Select the 3 to 5 
        cards by left clicking on each one individually and then pressing the 
        select button that will appear in the bottom right hand side of the screen.
        
        The left hand side of the screen will hold the deck of destination cards, 
        the deck of technology cards, the technology cards that you have purchased, 
        and finally the destination cards that you have selected (in that order, 
        from top to bottom).
        
        To choose to pick up more destination cards, left click on the destination
        card deck. This will draw 3 destination cards to the right hand side of
        the screen where you must select a minimum of 1, or up to all 3 of the cards. 
        The cards you choose will be added to your pile on the bottom left hand side of the 
        screen. If it is the first turn then 5 destination cards are shown and you must select
        at least 3 of the cards.
        Once you select a card then a transparent gray rectangle will appear over it.
        Hovering over the card will allow the 2 cities the card is associated with the be 
        highlited yellow.
        In the bottom left hand side are your own destination cards. Left or 
        right clicking on your destination cards will scroll through your
        pile. Doing so will allow you to see what paths have already been completed by
        highlighting the cities green instead of yellow. 
        
        The pile of technology cards are above the YOUR CARDS banner.
        You use the mouse wheel to scroll through the technology cards until you find
        the one you wish to purchase. Then left clicking it will list the cost to 
        purchase that card on the top of the right hand side of the screen. You
        then left click on each card (locomotive or regular train) in your hand until 
        you meet that requirement. Once that requirement is met, you press the Buy $ 
        button at the bottom of the screen. You may press the back button at any time 
        to cancel the purchase of the technology card. Purchasing the card will place 
        it in your pile on the left hand side of the screen and remove it from the 
        technology card deck that you scroll through when purchasing. If you have 
        multiple technology cards you can left/right click on your pile to scroll through them
        or use the mouse wheel.
        Note: You can only buy Technology cards at the beginning of your turn. Also, you must buy
        Equalising Beam and Risky Contracts before the deck gets reshuffled. You will know right
        before the deck gets reshuffled as you can no longer click the back of the deck card and
        as soon as a player picks up 1 of 5 cards on the table then the deck will reshuffle.
        
        The right hand of the screen contains the train card deck and the 5 randomly drawn
        train cards at the top, followed by any train cards or locomotives that you have
        picked up, then the directions button that can be left clicked to look at how to
        play the game, and finally the current player, their points and his/her remaining 
        trains in the circle of the ticket. All actions on the right hand side of the 
        screen are performed by left clicking.
        
        During game play, the right hand side will change to accomodate certain actions 
        being taken by the player. The very top of the right side will show any 
        destination cards that must be chosen, it will display the number of locomotives 
        and train cards needed to purchase a technology card or a track on the map, it will 
        move your train cards up from your deck when purchasing a technology card or track, 
        and it will display the back button, the buy button, the select button, and finally,
        the switch user button when certain conditions are met.
        
        During normal game play you may choose to purchase a technology card at
        the beginning of your turn only. After that is purchased you may do one of
        the following:
            Pick up more destination cards
            Pick up 2 train cards that are face up on the right hand side (1 if it
                is a locomotive)
            Pick up 2 random train cards from the deck (even if 1 is a locomotive)
            Purchase a track on the map
                Hovering your mouse over the track will highlite it if you have
                    the necessary technology cards required in order to purchase
                    it. If not, the track will not highlight and you will be unable
                    to purchase it.
                Left click on the track to purchase it. The top right hand side of the
                    screen will display the cost to purchase that track. Left click on
                    the trains or locomotives in your hand and then click the Ticket to
                    ride button when it appears. After purchasing the track, the color
                    of the track will change to the player's color to indicate that it
                    belongs to them. If more than one player owns a track, click the track
                    to rotate through the different colors of the players who won the track.
            After you have done one of the above, your turn is over and you must press
                the Switch User button.
                    
        A dot of your color will move along the perimeter of the map to indicate the current
        score of each player. As well as being indicated on the ticket.
        
        Play continues in this fashion until one of the players has fewer than 3 trains
            remaining. At that point each player will have one more turn before the
            game ends. Once the game ends, the total points for each player is totaled
            and the winner will pop up in a new window. After which, you can right/left
            through each player's destination cards to see which cities they were 
            able to connect. If the player completed the ticket then the cities will be 
            highlited green otherwise the cities will be highlited red. Another pannel of 
            all of the destination tickets completed with their current score before destination
            cards were taken into account and their final score at the bottom along with their
            scores from risky contracts or equalizing beam.
